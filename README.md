# PWA-CodeNote-Editor
 Progressive Web Application Text Editor: This repository hosts a browser-based text editor designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It features offline functionality, data persistence through IndexedDB, and deployability as a desktop app. Built with modern web technologies like Webpack, Babel, and Workbox, it allows users to create and manage notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. Deployed and functional on Render, this application showcases robust client-server architecture and responsive UI for an optimal user experience.

```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a text editor web application,
WHEN I open my application in my editor,
THEN I should see a client server folder structure.
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory,

WHEN I run my webpack plugins,
THEN I should have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
